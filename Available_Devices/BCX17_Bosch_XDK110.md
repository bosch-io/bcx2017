## Ideas for using this device

The XDK110 is a universal programmable sensor device that enables rapid prototyping of sensor based products and small batch applications for the Internet of Things (IoT). Inclusive of multiple Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) sensors, the XDK110 enables time and cost effective realization of IoT applications while offering users the freedom of programming from a basic to an advanced level. The XDK110 is an integrated product that offers access to the XDK developer community for active information exchange, knowledge sharing, technical support and more. The device was designed to allow users an easy transition from prototype to mass production by providing a clear road to product development.

## Additional information

Available with the XDK Workbench Version 2.0.0 onwards, the XDK Workbench ships with an additional feature called Firmware Over the Air (FOTA). FOTA is a method to update your firmware wirelessly, i.e. over Wi-Fi. To do so, please make sure that your bootloader is FOTA compatible by overwriting your current bootloader as described in chapter 3.6.2 (if necessary) and your current bootloader type is set to „FOTA Compatible“ in the XDK preferences.
