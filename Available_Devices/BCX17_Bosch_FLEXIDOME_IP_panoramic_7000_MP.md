## Device capabilities

On top of recording video, the cameras can also
- analyse ambient audio
- receive external alarm signals
- detect shaking of the camera

These signals are then processed and can be used to generate _events_. By default, cameras detect objects
entering the frame and sent out an event `object_seen`. Additional events (including video analytics (IVA))
can be configured directly inside the camera.

### Example telemetry data


## Ideas for using this device

- Take a picture with camera when a face is detected and send this picture for analysis into the cloud
- Alarm when the noise level is too high
