## Available devices

We have several AMRA kits available that publish telemetry and events into Hono using a device ID  `amra.<imei>`.

Each AMRA kit regularly transmits sensor data such as acceleration, GPS position, and temperature as telemetry, and also publishes events once a shock is detected.
